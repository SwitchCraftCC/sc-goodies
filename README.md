Fabric 1.20 mod for the SwitchCraft server. "Lemmmy's bag of tricks" - a collection of tiny additions designed for the
SwitchCraft server in the style of many older mods. Highly opinionated.

## Features

- Basic iron chests, in the style of cpw's [ironchest](https://github.com/progwml6/ironchest).
